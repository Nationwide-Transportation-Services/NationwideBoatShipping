							<div class="service-detail-para">

								<p>Nationwide Boat Transport offers shipping solutions to any customer in need of a dependable source of logistics for their boat. Most commonly, we deal with the most common general yachts, fishing boats and sailboats, which necessitate standard methods of shipping, such as flatbed and drop deck trailers. It is also quite common for clients with their boats already loaded onto a trailer to contact us for a way to transport the trailer for them on a longer, inter-state trip, such as from Illinois to Rhode Island. This calls for our power only service, in which one of Nationwide's expert technicians connects the customer's trailer to one of our tractors and transports it to the destination.</p>
