         <p>Here are some common types of fishing boats that Nationwide helps our customers ship, whether their fishing is recreational or commercial.</p>
         </div>

             <h3>Multi-Species Boats</h3>                            
              <p>Due to their sturdy frame and construction, these versatile boats are prepared to fish in different types of water and weather, and hinted by the name, are used for hauling in a wide range of fish varieties. Multi-species boats usually run around 17-23 ft.</p>
          </div>
       <div class="col-sm-4 text-center overlay-text icons">
              <img src="img/walkaround.png" width="290" height="265" alt=""/>
            <h3>Walkarounds</h3>
            <p>For fishing on larger water bodies, walkarounds are for anglers that desire some space for fishing, as the name suggests. They typically range from 20 ft. to about 30 ft. in length.</p>
        </div>
      <br>

              <h3>Bass Boats</h3>
              <p>Bass boats are specialized for freshwater fishing, equipped with a high-performance outboard engine. They usually run about 14 to 23ft. and are designed especially for bass fishing on lakes and rivers.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
      <br>
              <h3>Downeast Cruisers</h3>
              <p>Typically observed in the American New England region, these boats are used for fishing but have all the amenities for cruising, such as a dining area and covered cabin.</p>
      
      
              <h3>Express Fisherman</h3>
              <p>Built primarily for speed, the Express Fisherman has space to fish and can travel to offshore fishing locations as quickly as possible.</p>

          <h2>How to Ship a Fishing Boat</h2>
          <p>When transporting a fishing boat, it's important to properly prep the boat before shipping. First, the bottom of the hull will have to be completely cleaned, to remove all organic plant matter and living organisms. States have become very strict about what is coming in or going out of their ecosystems, so your boat may be inspected. Next, all personal items, loose rigging, and removable parts will be removed and packaged separately for safe transport. The boat shipping experts at Nationwide Boat Shipping will take care to ensure your fishing boat is completely ready for the road before shipping.<strong> Call (800) 352-8475 to talk with one of our logistics professionals for a free no obligation quote today!</strong></p>
